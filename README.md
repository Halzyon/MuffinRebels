## How to play

First, you the player would start their turn by rolling two 6-sided 
dice (D6) to see how many tiles you can walk.
After you have exhausted all your "energy" it will be the
enemies' turn to move.
If you would so happen to meet the misfortune of being
seen and targeted by the enemy, combat will begin.

During combat, if the enemy spotted you first, the enemy will
be the first to attack, and you will defend, and after rolling
your available dice, you will attack and the enemy will defend
and this will alternate until one of you dies.

For combat, you and the enemy will roll for the maximum
number of available dice to fight with. The defender may only
defend with one less dice than their maximum number of combat
dice. If the attacker has more dice than the defender, the
defender's number of dice will be used instead as the minimum
number of dice to be rolled.

First, the attacker and defender get to choose which dice
they want to use to roll with. After which, the one with the lower
value takes damage equal to the difference between both dice.
This keeps going until the minimum number of dice has been
rolled. And then the attackers and defenders will swap.
